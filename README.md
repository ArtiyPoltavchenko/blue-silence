After nearly two years, Natalia Merrow’s apartment was opened for the first time.
Nothing was out of place. The curtains were drawn. A half-full glass of water still sat beside the bed. The whole space felt too perfect — like someone had staged it, or worse, preserved it.

On her desk, a laptop lay closed, its screen black. When powered on, a single unsent email appeared: “They took the role. Someone paid the captain. I’m not safe.”

Next to it, an envelope labeled in bold handwriting:
“Natalia – this is your Oscar. Just say yes.”
Inside was a full script titled The Blue Silence.

Across the room, a photo frame had fallen slightly askew. Behind the cracked glass, Natalia smiled with another woman — her face violently scratched out from the inside.

But the most disturbing detail wasn’t the photo, or even the ash in the fireplace. It was a magazine clipping pinned to the corkboard.
“Marla Vance cast as lead in upcoming thriller ‘The Blue Silence’”
The film had begun shooting six months after Natalia’s death.

And tucked inside her wardrobe, hidden behind old coats, a sealed envelope bore the name of the yacht’s captain.
It was postmarked four days after she supposedly drowned.
