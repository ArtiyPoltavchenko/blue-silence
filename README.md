
Introduction: A Call in the Early Hours

You are a seasoned detective, used to long nights and early mornings. Just as the first hints of dawn creep through your blinds, your phone rings, shattering the silence.

Groggy, you reach for it. The caller ID reads: John - NYPD

John: "Hey, I know it’s early, but you need to get down here. There's an elderly woman waiting for you in the office. She says it’s urgent."

Without hesitation, you throw on your coat and head out. Something tells you this isn’t just another routine case.
