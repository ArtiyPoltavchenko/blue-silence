Detective Carter stepped into the office, the weight of exhaustion pressing down on his shoulders. The early morning rain battered the windows, casting a gloomy light throughout the room. The sky outside was a thick gray blanket, reflecting the heaviness in the air.

He paused for a moment, scanning the room. In the corner of the office, an elderly woman sat in an old chair. Her face was drawn with worry, her hands trembling as she gripped her purse tightly. When she noticed Carter had entered, she quickly lifted her head. Desperation and fear filled her eyes.


Natalie Wood's Mother Arrives

Maria Wood: Detective Carter! My daughter... my daughter Natalie... she didn't die!

Detective Carter: (Startled) Mrs. Wood? What do you mean? Your daughter's death was ruled an accident years ago…

Maria Wood: (Her voice trembling) No! It wasn’t an accident! I have proof.

With shaking hands, she pulled an old laptop from her bag.


The Lost Email Draft

Maria powered on the laptop and showed Detective Carter an unsent email draft from Natalie. Leaning in, he read the words on the screen:

"Mom, I have something terrible to tell you. I don’t feel safe on this boat. Robert is tense and aggressive. He and Christopher had an argument, and they’ve been acting strangely toward me. I need to get out of here, but I don’t know how. If something happens, please believe me. This won’t be an accident. I love you. - Natalie"

Detective Carter stared at the screen for a long moment. The doubt inside him grew.

Detective Carter: This... this changes everything, Mrs. Wood. I'm reopening the case.

The dusty Natalie Wood case file was placed on the desk. The murder investigation... had officially begun.
