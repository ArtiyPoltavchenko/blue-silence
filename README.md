Security Office
The Security Office is your go-to place for ensuring the safety and smooth operation of all vessels within the Sea Port. 
Our team monitors the movement of ships, both while they’re traveling and docked. We handle any security concerns, incidents, or suspicious activities on the premises.
If you're looking for important logs, incident reports, or need any assistance regarding port safety, this is where you’ll find it.

Note: Remember, certain critical information is always kept confidential for security reasons. If you're looking for hidden files or sensitive data, they are not always easily accessible – discretion is key.
