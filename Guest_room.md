# 🛏️ Guest Room – Natalia’s Apartment

The door creaks open.

Soft light spills across a neatly made bed.  
The air smells faintly of linen and dust.

There are no personal items.  
No suitcases. No notes. No signs of recent use.

It’s quiet. Still.

You gently close the door behind you.
